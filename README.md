Assignment 5
==============

Program Description
===================

This assignment demonstrates two fundamental Python concepts: **Dictionary creation** and **List slicing**.  
Each task is explained with its purpose, functionality, and example code.

---

## Task 1: Create a Dictionary of Student Marks
-----------------------------------------------

### 📌 Objective
To create a dictionary that stores student names as **keys** and their marks as **values**.  
This demonstrates how dictionaries can be used to manage structured data.

### 🛠️ Functionality

- A dictionary is created with student names and marks.  
- The program iterates through the dictionary to display each student’s marks.  
- This shows ,(Marks) access vallue using keys. 

### ✅ Example

Enetr The Student's Name : Gurpreet
The Gurpreet marks is : 71


Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing
--------------------------------
📌 Objective
To demonstrate list slicing by extracting the first 5 elements of a list and reversing them.

🛠️ Functionality
A list of numbers is created.

The first 5 elements are extracted using slicing ([:5]).

The extracted list is reversed using slicing ([::-1]).

### ✅ Example

Origibal List :  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Extracted First Five element :  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Reversed Extracted Elements :  [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
